  title = {{Local Computations with Probabilities on Graphical Structures and
	Their Application to Expert Systems}},

  abstract = {{A causal network is used in a number of areas as a depiction of patterns
	of `influence' among sets of variables. In expert systems it is common
	to perform `inference' by means of local computations on such large
	but sparse networks. In general, non-probabilistic methods are used
	to handle uncertainty when propagating the effects of evidence, and
	it has appeared that exact probabilistic methods are not computationally
	feasible. Motivated by an application in electromyography, we counter
	this claim by exploiting a range of local representations for the
	joint probability distribution, combined with topological changes
	to the original network termed `marrying' and `filling-in'. The resulting
	structure allows efficient algorithms for transfer between representations,
	providing rapid absorption and propagation of evidence. The scheme
	is first illustrated on a small, fictitious but challenging example,
	and the underlying theory and computational aspects are then discussed.}},
